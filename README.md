# Actually Smart Search for YouTube

Our mission is to provide a better search experience for YouTube users.
Imagine YouTube search that understands you. Not just keywords—your real questions, your intent, your curiosity. A search that doesn’t just find videos but finds answers. This is smart search, reimagined.

## Demo
